### 1. Introduction

Approximately every 4 years, the sea surface temperature (SST) is higher than average in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon is called El NinÌƒo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and is considered as the dominant mode of interannual climate variability observed globally (Wunsch 1990). ENSO is associated with many climate changes (Fraedrich 1994; Wilkinson et al.1999), affecting climate of much of the tropics and subtropics, then cause enormous damage worldwide, so a skillful forecasting of ENSO is strongly needed.

1. What is ENSO and its extremely impacts (why a skillful forecasting is very important);


2. Methods to study ENSO currently (Climate method and it should be improved with longer prediction ahead);

	predict result not well enough + computationally expensive --> remain room for further study of this problem.


3. ENSO is a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem and DL (machine learning) methods have great potential to handle this problem. exist work have been attempet to this problem. However, little work have been done with this problem for exploring the spatial and temporal information of SST pattern.

2 (or 3) complex factors:

* Spatial dependencies

* Temporal dependencies

* Exernal influence (TBD)

we formulize the grid SST pattern problem and use the Convolutional LSTM model to capture the spatial and temporal information of ENSO development simultaneously,

In summary, The contributions of our work are 2 (or 3)-fold: 

* We formulize the ENSO SST pattern forecasting problem, a I * J grid map based on longitude and latitude where a grid donates a region of NINO3.4, which can be converted as a multi-channels physical parameters setting spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem;

* We apply Convolutional LSTM network, which can capture the spatial and temporal information of SST data effectively, to predict ENSO with -6, -9, -12 monthly ahead respectively, the result show that our model outperform other neural network models and conventional statistical model.

* TBD
